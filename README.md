-   Abstract:

The anti-tobacco campaign in the mid to late 20th century is widely considered one of the most successful public health campaigns in American history. Even so, according to the CDC, smoking remains the number one cause of preventable death and disease in the United States, causing roughly 480,000 deaths per year. An exploration of 2013 smoking and demographic data allows one to investigate the relationships between smoking prevelance, regulation, and outcomes in the United States and address the following questions: How do smoking trends in the United States vary by region? What demographic variables correlate most strongly with lung cancer death rates? Do high cigarette taxes correlate with lower smoking or lung cancer death rates? Ultimately, this investigation aims to illuminate the long-term legacy of the anti-tobacco campaign in the United States.
